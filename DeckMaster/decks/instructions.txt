If you want to store each deck as a separate JSON file locally, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Directory for JSON Files**:
   First, create a directory (folder) in your project where you'll store the JSON files. You can name this directory something like "decks" to keep things organized.

2. **Generate Unique Filenames**:
   To store each deck as a separate JSON file, you should generate unique filenames for each deck. You can use a combination of the deck name, a timestamp, or any other unique identifier to create these filenames. For example:

   ```javascript
   const deckFilename = `${deck.name}-${Date.now()}.json`;
   ```

3. **Serialize and Save Decks to JSON Files**:
   When a new deck is created, serialize it to JSON using `JSON.stringify` and save it as a separate JSON file in your "decks" directory. You can use Node.js (if you're developing this app locally) to handle file operations. Here's an example of how you can save a deck to a JSON file:

   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs'); // Node.js's built-in File System module

   // Your deck object
   const deck = {
     name: 'My Deck',
     description: 'A great deck for learning!',
     cards: []
   };

   // Generate a unique filename
   const deckFilename = `${deck.name}-${Date.now()}.json`;

   // Serialize the deck to JSON
   const deckJSON = JSON.stringify(deck);

   // Specify the directory where you want to save the JSON files
   const directory = 'decks';

   // Save the JSON to a file
   fs.writeFileSync(`${directory}/${deckFilename}`, deckJSON);
   ```

4. **Load Decks from JSON Files**:
   To load decks, you can read the JSON files from your "decks" directory and parse them back into JavaScript objects using `JSON.parse`. Here's an example of how to load a deck from a JSON file:

   ```javascript
   // Specify the directory where your JSON files are stored
   const directory = 'decks';

   // Read the JSON file
   const deckJSON = fs.readFileSync(`${directory}/${deckFilename}`, 'utf8');

   // Parse the JSON data back into a JavaScript object
   const loadedDeck = JSON.parse(deckJSON);

   // Now, 'loadedDeck' contains the data from the JSON file.
   ```

By following these steps, you can save each deck as a separate JSON file in your local directory and load them as needed. Be sure to handle file operations carefully and consider error handling for file I/O operations in your app.
